# RubiksCube

Written by: Almog Dubin & Reut Shmuel 

A Rubik's cube implementation in opengl 

How to use:

R, L U, D, F, B rotate the walls of the cube.

Z will divide the rotation angel by 2.

A will multiply the rotation angel by 2 (up to 180).

"space" will flip rotation direction.


Mouse scroll will change the cube geometric size (zoom in and out).

Left click will rotate the cube (globally).

Right click will translate the cube.




Bonus:

To change from a 3X3X3 cube to a 2,4 or 5 cube change in RubiksCube.h the RUBIK_SIZE from 3 to what ever.
X  if the cube is bigger then 3X3X3 , X will move the rotation wall to the center (and back).

M will mix the cube.
